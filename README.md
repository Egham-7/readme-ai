## Project Overview
**README AI** is a full-stack application that utilizes AI capabilities, built with a React frontend, a backend API, and a PostgreSQL database, along with MinIO object storage. The key features include:
* **AI-powered functionality**: Leveraging machine learning models for intelligent processing
* **React frontend**: A user-friendly interface built with React, utilizing Vite as the development server and TypeScript as the programming language
* **Backend API**: A robust API handling requests and interactions with the database and object storage
* **PostgreSQL database**: A relational database management system for storing and managing data
* **MinIO object storage**: A cloud-native object storage system for storing and serving files

## Quick Start
To get started with the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Egham-7/readme-ai.git`
2. Change into the directory: `cd readme-ai`
3. Build the project: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Run the application: `docker-compose exec frontend npm run dev`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure your system meets the following requirements:
* **Language**: JavaScript (with TypeScript for the frontend)
* **Build Tools**: Docker, Docker Compose
